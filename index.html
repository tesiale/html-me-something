                    <p>We were told this area does have the occasional bears roaming around, how scary! Good thing we carry around bear spray just in case..! Fortunately we never had to use it.</p>

                    <h1>Climbing up the trail...</h1>
                    <p>Following the trailheads, we zigged and zagged around the forest grounds, slowing making our ascent.</p>

                    <h1>Halfway there...!</h1>
                    <p>The trail eventually lead to a break from the forest trees to the gorgeous sky and view. Our halfway point was where we decided to stop for a break and just enjoy the view and atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>Forest eventually gave way to rocky gravelly terrain as we continued our trek above.</p>
